* Killer International Draughts
  Day 1.

  Self play is using an artificial n_rule (set to 10ply), which allows for draws in the rules
  without repetition.  The step in n_rule is reset to 1 if (a) there is a capture, (b) a man moves.

  Killer Draughts differs from vanilla Draughts, in that when a king captures, it must land on the
  next diagonal space.  Apparently this leads to less draws in high level games.  The inputs to
  neural network are exactly the same as vanilla International Draughts, thereby it would be easy
  use transfer learning to train vanilla.

* elo graph
  Each model has ran a minimum of 100 games with a randomised matching algorithm continuous
  tournament.  Each match is configured with a small amount of noise, and 800 evaluations per move.

  - The y-axis is ELO.
  - The x-axis is somewhat arbitrary in terms of compute.  Each model produced has a numeric value,
    which goes up incrementally as training progresses.
  - random player has a fixed ELO of 500.
