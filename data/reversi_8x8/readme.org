* Reversi 8x8

* elo graph
  Each model has ran a minimum of 100 games with a randomised matching algorithm continuous
  tournament.  Each match is configured with a small amount of noise, and 800 evaluations per move.

  - The y-axis is ELO.
  - The x-axis is somewhat arbitrary in terms of compute.  Each model produced has a numeric value,
    which goes up incrementally as training progresses.
  - random player has a fixed ELO of 500.
