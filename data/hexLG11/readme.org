* Hex 11

  Models here:

 - h1 : first attempt at training - expert iteration 2018
 - b1 : fresh run, 2019.  A0 method - small network, 200 evals per move, 25% oscillating,
   approximately 60 generations per day with 3 1080 GPUs.

* elo graph

  Each model has ran a minimum of 100 games with a randomised matching algorithm continuous
  tournament.  Each match is configured with a small amount of noise, and 800 evaluations per move.

  - The y-axis is ELO.
  - The x-axis is somewhat arbitrary in terms of compute.  Each model produced has a numeric value, which goes up incrementally as training progresses.
  - random player has a fixed ELO of 500.
