English Draughts
----------------
h1_61 - about 30 hours of training English Draughts.  Not very interesting game - one side gains a
piece advantage then spends 100 moves trying to rid the other side, was curious if handled draws
(about 40% of training data), which turned out ok.

Assuming not very strong, but it beats simple MCTS player easily.

Trained at approx ggp-zero commit [83f7fe3](https://github.com/ggplib/ggp-zero/commit/83f7fe33aa2d57ebb4b4f59747b949cf17c51141)
