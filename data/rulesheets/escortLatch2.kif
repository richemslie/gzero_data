; Escort breakthrough, with an explicit latch
; by Alex Landau, 5/28/11
; 
; This is a breakthrough variant in which each side has a king as well
; as a phalanx of pawns. Players only win if their king makes it to the
; other side; pawns don't count.
;
; The game description is slightly contrived in order to make the presence
; of a latch easy to detect. It would be interesting to see which latch
; detection techniques could work on a more general version of the game.
;
; Will need a step counter, unlike most versions of breakthrough.
;
; Kings are constrained so they can't move backwards, mostly to help
; guide depth charges. (They can still move sideways.)

; Modified variant by rxe 1/24/18, making it super hard for mcts players.
; longer.  king has to go from one corner to diagonally opposite corner.
