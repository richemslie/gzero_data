* Breakthrough

  Models here:

  - kt1_206 - experimental best model
  - x6_164 - ICGA model
  - x6_111
  - x6_102

  The following models were ran on Little Golem:

  All games before and include game #1929586 - x6_102
  To  #1929586 - x6_111
  All games after #1959831 - x6_164

  Trained at approx ggp-zero commit [[https://github.com/ggplib/ggp-zero/commit/55663753ed479d449af80b1a7b93525bca5c9430][5566375]]

  Special thanks to Richard Lorentz & Fabien Letouzey for entertaining mini competitions to evaluate the strength of
  models/bot on LG.

  Each model has ran a minimum of 100 games with a randomised matching algorithm continuous
  tournament.  Each match is configured with a small amount of noise, and 800 evaluations per move.

  - The y-axis is ELO.
  - The x-axis is somewhat arbitrary in terms of compute.  Each model produced has a numeric value, which goes up incrementally as training progresses.
  - The crosses are fixed players (ie no generation).   random player has a fixed ELO of 500.

  X6 - run was performed in early 2018, and was expert iteration.

  kt - runs are all full matches, no expert iteration.

  kt1 - was hand tweaked config, with continuously upping the size of the network

  kt3/az1 - ran with largely fixed, same config of ~200 evals per move (XXX need to check).  kt3
  used oscillating move generation (taking 20% of moves) - whereas az1 is full matches (ie
  AlphaZero method, taking 100% of moves).  network was enlarged during run.  Suprising similar
  results, need to double check.

  kt5 - configured with a very small network, and ran with maximum number evals so could continuously
  train, and just left to run unattended for for 3 days (with 3 gpus).

  f1 - another longer run with small network.

  *Conclusion: quantity of data triumphs quality - as long train early & train often*
