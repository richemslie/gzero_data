* Breakthrough Small (6x6)
  Models here:

  - x1 : first attempt, expert iteration. seems very strong.  unbeatable?
  - h2 : testing symmetries
  - b1 : A0 method & host of features.

  Special thanks to Richard Lorentz for entertaining mini competitions to evaluate the strength of
  models/bot on LG.

* elo graph
  Each model has ran a minimum of 100 games with a randomised matching algorithm continuous
  tournament.  Each match is configured with a small amount of noise, and 800 evaluations per move.

  - The y-axis is ELO.
  - The x-axis is somewhat arbitrary in terms of compute.  Each model produced has a numeric
    value, which goes up incrementally as training progresses.
  - random player has a fixed ELO of 500.
