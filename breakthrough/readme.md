Breakthrough
------------
v5_92 - was the first attempt at training breakthrough, over Xmas 2017 and early January 2018.  It
did not use multiple policies, but will run with commit
[5566375](https://github.com/ggplib/ggp-zero/commit/55663753ed479d449af80b1a7b93525bca5c9430).


The following models were ran on Little Golem:
All games before and include game #1929586 - x6_102
All games after #1929586 - x6_111

Trained at approx ggp-zero commit [5566375](https://github.com/ggplib/ggp-zero/commit/55663753ed479d449af80b1a7b93525bca5c9430).

Special thanks to Richard Lorentz for entertaining a mini competition to evaluate the strength of
models/bot on LG.
